# The Plaintext OT Type, with proper unicode positions

This OT type can be used to edit plaintext documents, like sourcecode or
markdown. It allows invertible or non-invertible text operations.

For documentation on the API spec this type implements, see [ottypes/docs](/ottypes/docs).

There's also compatible versions of this library in [C](https://github.com/ottypes/libot), [rust](https://github.com/josephg/textot.rs) and [swift](https://github.com/josephg/libot-swift).

This type is *almost* identical to the original [text type](https://github.com/ottypes/text). The difference is that text-unicode counts positions based on the number of unicode codepoints instead of javascript string length (UCS2 2-byte offsets). For example, "üò≠" is a single unicode codepoint but `"üò≠".length === 2` in javascript. In text, this is 2 characters (which propogates what I consider a bug in javascript). In text-unicode, this is counted as just 1 character. Considering it as 1 character is slightly less performant in javascript, but makes interop with other languages much easier.


## Usage

```
# npm add ot-text-unicode
```

then use it like any other OT type:

```javascript
const {type} = require('ot-text-unicode')

type.apply('hi there', [3, {d:5}, 'ü§ñüëªüíÉ']) // -> 'hi ü§ñüëªüíÉ'
```

There are helper methods for simple insert and remove operations:

```javascript
const {type, insert, remove} = require('ot-text-unicode')

const op1 = insert(2, "hi there") // returns [2, "hi there"]

// Operations which delete characters can optionally specify which characters were deleted:
const op2inv = remove(2, "hi there") // returns [2, {d:"hi there"}]
const op2noinv = remove(2, 8) // returns [2, {d:8}]

const addThenRemove = type.compose(op1, op2inv) // Returns [], aka no-op!
```


### Using a rope with text-unicode

This library has also been extended to allow you to specify your own fancy rope type, and apply operations efficiently. Neato üåØ! To use it, you'll need to implement your own rope type, or use a rope library on npm:

```javascript
const myRopeFns = {
  create(str) { return new Rope(str) },
  toString(rope) { return rope.toString() },

  builder(rope) {
    // Used for applying operations
    let pos = 0 // character position in unicode code points

    return {
      skip(n) { pos += n },

      append(s) { // Insert s at the current position
        rope.insert(pos, s)
        pos += unicodeLength(s)
      },

      del(n) { // Delete n characters at the current position
        rope.del(pos, n)
      },

      build() { // Finish!
        return rope
      },
    }
  }
}
```

Then use it:

```javascript
const type = require('ot-text-unicode').makeType(myRopeFns)

let doc = type.create('hi there')
doc = type.apply(doc, [3, {d:5}, 'ü§ñüëªüíÉ']) // -> 'hi ü§ñüëªüíÉ'

// If your rope functions modify doc in-place, so will apply.
```

### Inverting operations

Its often useful to be able to invert an operation to support undo. To invert an operation either:

1. The operation needs to contain a copy of all deleted characters instead of simply specifying how many characters are deleted. Eg, `[{d:'hi'}]` instead of `[{d:2}]`.
2. Or when inverting an operation you can use `type.invertWithDoc(op, doc)`, providing a copy of what the document looked like *before* the operation was applied.

Note invert support has been added recently, and may not be supported by text-unicode implementations in other languages.

```javascript
const {type} = require('ot-text-unicode')

const op1 = [2, {d: 5}] // Delete 5 characters at position 2
type.invert(op1) // ERROR: Will throw because the operation doesn't contain deleted characters

// Option 1: add all deleted characters into the operation:
const op2 = [2, {d: 'hello'}] // Delete 5 characters ('hello') at position 2
type.invert(op2) // Ok - returns `[2, 'hello']`

// Option 2: Use invertWithDoc to generate an operation's inverse
type.invertWithDoc(op1, 'a hello') // Ok - returns `[2, 'hello']`.
```

Invertibility information will be preserved through calls to transform and compose, if all provided operations are invertible. Note this is not the case for some other types, like json1.


### Transforming cursor positions

If you have another user's cursor position, you can transform that cursor using `type.transformPosition` or `type.transformSelection`:

```javascript
const {type} = require('ot-text-unicode')
let doc = '...'
let cursors = [{user: 'jane', pos: 5}, {user: 'fred', pos: 100}]

function onRemoteOp(op) {
  for (let user of cursors) {
    // Update user positions based on the incoming operation
    user.pos = type.transformPosition(user.pos, op)
  }

  doc = type.apply(doc, op)
}
```

**Note** For consistency, just like other methods, `transformPosition` operates on unicode cursor positions, not raw JS string positions. If you're using this with JS string positions, you have two options:

1. (Recommended) Convert your positions to unicode codepoint positions before calling `transformPosition`. The simplest way is to call `cursor = require('unicount').strPosToUni(doc_contents, jsPosition)`.
2. Use the older version of `transformPosition` which operates on raw JS offsets. [Code to do that is in this github gist](https://gist.github.com/josephg/cc0a125a2d6a7637dabc79a865a7483c).


## Spec

The plaintext OT type thinks of the document as a giant unicode string, and
edits index unicode characters in the string. This is different from most text
editors, which break up a document into an array of lines. For small documents
on modern computers, the conversion isn't particularly expensive. However, if
you have giant documents you should be using a rope library like
[jumprope](https://github.com/josephg/jumprope) or
[librope](https://github.com/josephg/librope).

Each operation describes a traversal over the document. The traveral can edit
the document as it goes.

For example, given the document:

```
"ABCDEFG"
```

You could apply the operation

```
[1, ' hi ', 2, {d:3}]
```

This operation will skip (retain) the first character (1), insert ' hi ', skip 2 more
characters then delete the next 3 characters. The result would be:

```
"A hi BCG"
```

### Operation components

Each operation is a list of components. The components describe a traversal of the document, modifying the document along the way. Each component is one of:

- **Number N**: Skip (retain) the next *N* characters in the document
- **"str"**: Insert *"str"* at the current position in the document
- **{d:N}**: Delete *N* characters at the current position in the document
- **{d:"str"}**: Delete the string *"str"* at the current position in the document. This is functionally identical to *{d:N}* but allows an operation to be inverted, which is useful for undo support.

The operation does not have to skip the last characters in the document.


### Selections

The text type also has methods for manipulating selections.

Selection ranges are either a single number (the cursor position) or a pair of
[anchor, focus] numbers (aka [start, end]) of the selection range. Be aware
that end can be before start.


# Other implementations

I have compatible implementations of this OT type in:

- [C](https://github.com/share/libot/blob/master/text.h). This implementation is insanely fast (~20M transforms / second on my old laptop, not that that will ever be a bottleneck.)
- [Rust](https://github.com/josephg/textot.rs). This code is much less mature, but far more concise and beautiful than the C or JS implementations.
- [Swift](https://github.com/josephg/libot-swift)

# Commentary

This is the 4th iteration of ShareJS's plaintext type.


The [first
iteration](https://github.com/share/ShareJS/blob/0.6/src/types/text2.coffee) was
similar, except it forces all operations to be invertable. Invertability is
nice, but I want to eventually build an arbitrary P2P OT system, and in a p2p
setting invertibility becomes impractical to achieve. I don't want systems to
depend on it.

The second iteration made each component specify a location and an edit there.
Operations were lists of these edits. Because the components were not sorted,
if you transform two big operations by one another it requires M\*N
time to transform. The components could be sorted to fix this, but if you're
going to do that you may as well just make them sorted by design - which is
what the current text implementation does. I thought the individual edits style
was better because I expected it to be simpler, but when I implemented it I
found the implementation of each method was almost identical in size.

The [3rd iteration](https://github.com/ottypes/text) is 99% identical to this
codebase, except it used UTF16 word offsets instead of unicode codepoints.
This implementation considers emoji ü§∏üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è as 1 character. ottypes/text
considers that as 2 characters instead, because it takes a pair of UTF16
values to store (`"ü§ì".length === 2` in javascript). This makes it awkward to
build cross-platform OT systems spanning platforms which don't accept use JS's
awkward unicode encoding.
